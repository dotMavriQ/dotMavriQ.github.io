      <description>Welcome to dotChat dotChat is a chat service provided by dotMavriQ and developed as well as improved by the users of the service. The intention of dotChat is to provide a social space that values tried and true methods of social interaction on the internet without the pestering algorithmical incentives put forward by big social media companies.
Please understand dotChat is not open to the public, it sustains itself with a rather small group of friends and will scale naturally on an invite-only basis.</description>
