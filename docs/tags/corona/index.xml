      <description>Am Porter Bridges I was asked to remove cartons that were clogging up the entrance at work this morning.
Looking at all of it I realized it would be somewhat of a logistical hardship to do in one go. Not that any of it was even remotely heavy but rather that the larger cartons contained so much junk that I would have to carry all of it in the boxes that contained the most stuff&amp;hellip; and it was heavy-handed work as it turns out.</description>

      <description>I had a bit of a stressful morning in all honesty. Maybe I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch enough sleep, not sure what it was, but I barely got to work on time.
Things did settle quickly enough though, and that&amp;rsquo;s always good, there&amp;rsquo;s a special kind of peace that comes with sitting down and focusing on work for a good couple of hours. I mean, not every day can be like that of course, but today was a day like that.</description>
