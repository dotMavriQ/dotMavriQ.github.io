My name is Jonatan and I live in a small town in Sweden.

I work as a [Web Developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer) and Social Media Manager for [Duva](https://duva.nu "Duva"), with experience in managing big ad campaigns and [CRM](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/crm/what-is-crm/).

My job involves brand strategy, visual design, and account management for a mindful but competitive approach. I am fueled by my passion for understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising as well as systems comprehension. I consider myself an 'eternal student' who is always eager to improve my foundations in web development and full stack comprehension as well as staying in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through continued fieldwork.

My hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to the creation of the [dotBlog](https://dotMavriQ.Life), where I write anything ranging from helpful guides and business insights as well as tips and tricks of the trade, productivity improvements and concerns in the field of IT.

When I'm not in the world of programming I engage in my musical interests. 

I have my studio at home and a band that I play bass in.

_I may or may not have an unhealthy collection of instruments._

Philosophy interests me profoundly and navigating the new political landscape intrigues me as much as it worries me. 

_We are indeed living in interesting times._

The most relaxing endeavor I engage, however, is cooking, and I'll be posting recipes for all those interested.
