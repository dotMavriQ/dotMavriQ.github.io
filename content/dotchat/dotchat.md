# Welcome to dotChat

dotChat is a chat service provided by dotMavriQ and developed as well as improved by the users of the service.
The intention of dotChat is to provide a social space that values tried and true methods of social interaction on the internet without the pestering algorithmical incentives put forward by big social media companies.

### Please understand

dotChat is not open to the public, it sustains itself with a rather small group of friends and will scale naturally on an invite-only basis.

## Technical commentary

dotChat is currently run using [the Matrix Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)").
The Matrix protocol is akin to technologies like [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) and [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) in that you don't have to stick to any particular application in order to interface with the technology.

So.. Matrix is kinda like "texting", it's not the app you use, it's the technology, or rather, the protocol used.

Matrix acts a lot like glorious tried and true methods of interacting on the internet such as IRC and XMPP.
It is particularly close to XMPP, but uses a preferred JSON-style formatting that has been proven to be faster in most cases than XMPP. Matrix is a Free Open Source endeavor. Matrix also allows for true federation.

True federation is like e-mail, you decide what you write, where it goes and when.
Other people will walk into the mindset behind the means of communication with the same intent.

Matrix, unlike most chat apps that one can use, is also decentralized, meaning that anyone can host their own server, invite people onto it, and in the future allow the server to interface with other servers that use the same protocol. It's all up to the person hosting the matrix server.

## Technical history

dotChat started in the middle of the 2010's by a bunch of friends who got tired of the crippling aspects of social media and the social conventions they bring forward.

> Facebook, for example, is beautiful in all the ways it is a convention most of everyone agrees to use in modern society, but the cost of use is bloated applications, advertising you can't avoid as well as well as development strategies put in place to keep you hooked.
>
> Arguably most social media sites are also "Too big not to fail", if
> you want to entertain this thought, here's Dunbars Number.

dotChat had it's humble beginnings on the GERTY server, an Arch Linux VPS running an instance of RocketChat.

[RocketChat](https://rocket.chat/) is yet another kind of chat service that allows for people to talk on the internet, it is Open Source and carried a lot of functionality that the dotChat community enjoyed and revered.

RocketChat could however never sort out a working mobile application with a stable means of notification.

This put a serious damper on the growth potential and sustainability of dotChat.

Finally something had to be done and Matrix was put in its place.

    A lot of comfortable functionality users remember from RocketChat are still sorely missing as of the time this is typed, but replacements will be incrementally added when possible.

Most users interface with dotChat through Riot, Riot is the most common application with the most familiar functionality one would expect from dotChat. The Web version as well as the mobile app offers a decent and quite stable alternative to previous versions of dotChat.

    dotChat is seen to be in 3.0 as of writing this. 2.0 neeeded a proper revamp to allow for federalization as well as other fundamental functionalities offered by Matrix + Riot, got scrapped and revised for the 3.0 release.

### The dotSetta Stone: 10 Site Wide Rules

 1. You shall **not** Spam
 2. You shall **not** use more than one account.
 3. You shall **not** harass other users.
 4. You shall **not** abuse the service.
 5. You shall **not** dox other users.
 6. You shall **not** condone or directly inspire drug use.
 7. You shall **attempt not to** monopolize conversations.
 8. You shall **attempt to** argue in good faith.
 9. You shall **avoid** sincerely unnecessary uploads to the service.
10. You shall **abide by** channel-wide rules in their respective channels.

***

#### Further elaborations:

**Rule no1.** is set as a consequence of realizing that dotChat is maintained by a small set of people, utilizing as thin monetary means as possible for the benefit of as many users as possible, _by spamming_, you accelerate the need for manual vetting and server-side sanitation in regards to uploads, _in regards to spamming text_ it is of great inconvenience and nuisance for all other users and is therefore forbidden.

**Rule no2.**. Is self explanatory, you only need one account, with deliberately free rules in regards to user handles and nicknames this rule is put in place to mitigate abuses of this as the service scales.

**Rule no3.**. Pretty self-explanatory, the social consequences of committing a crime on the service could ultimate be legally pursued and is therefore strictly forbidden.

**Rule no4.** This is meant to mitigate attempting exploits of clients and or the Matrix protocol for means of _the lulz_, errors of this nature are to be reported for the assured quality of the service.

**Rule no5.** Deliberately vague. You are on here in good faith, most channels require invites, do not leak writings of other users to people outside of the service with objectively bad intent. Do not share writings in other channels to channels with that same described intent.

**Rule no6.** There are other services for this should anyone feel inclined, dotChat does not want to be held legally nor morally responsible for reprehensible advice based on subjective opinions in regards to this.

**Rule no7.** No one likes an asshole, here it is in rule-form. The world does not revolve around you, deal with it.

**Rule no8.** While almost every user enjoys the odd argument every now and then, it is important to anchor it in something other than social domination and/or social dismissal as a result of an ongoing argument. _If impossible, agree to disagree._

**Rule no9.** _You might not view your 16th meme as spam_, this rule is in place to help you reflect on that. Sharing is nice, lingering in the gray area breaching Rule no.1 is not. If other users have not engaged yet, curb your enthusiasm for the sake of everyone else.

**Rule 10.** Every channel comes with its individual set of rules and implementations, breaching them repeatedly or with continuously bad intent means breaching this site-wide rule.

Breaches of site-wide rules are handled by **#Garden** and ruling decisions are issued when a decision has been made. Breaches may result in a documented warning and/or a permanent ban.

_The dotSetta stone_, per-channel  guidelines, suggestions, feedback and reflections can be discussed at **#META**.

## Channels

Channels are topically bond social spaces provided by dotChat in order to focus on certain topics while also respecting the social conventions of strengthening bonds in closed spaces of conversations. The topics are there to aid in user experience but will not be enforced to the detriment on any collection of users for a channel.

| NAME | TOPIC |
| --- | --- |
| Lawn | Landing pad, new and old users meet and interact. |
| Garden | The walled Garden, housing the OG's. |
| Mire | The backwoods of dotChat, shitposting/fringe and edgy content lives here. |
| Floppy | A place to discuss Code, Hacking and Maker topics et.c. |
| Weeb | A place to discuss Anime, the Japanese language and Japanese culture. |
| META | Discussions surrounding dotChat. |
| Arstotzka | Encrypted chatroom to be used in times of war or repression. |
| Duvember | niche channel for employees of Duva and Ember. Unofficial backup, meta. |

### General metaguideline:

Channels gathered to suit the needs of a small group at a small point in time is normal.
They get created, they burn out, they can be erased or forgotten with short notice.

The channels that represent the community however ought not to and should pose as good measures for the community while _temporary channels_ would be subjected to pruning if the server runs out of sufficient space.

New channels can therefore be requested in **#Meta** but will be judged by **#Garden** before ultimately being created as something sustained, moderated, maintained and endorsed.. no one is stopping organic creations of aforementioned, typically short lived channels however, as it should be.

### Channel-wide Rules:

**#Lawn:**

1. Don't be insufferable.
2. Avoid rapid-fire 1-on-1 discussions.

**#Garden:**

1. Garden sustains itself on social conventions and dialectics that have been developed over time.
   The only rule, should it ever need to be enforced, is that the final word falls on the council of three.
   **dotMavriQ, dotMargui** and **Kirreeen** need to reach the final decision if members of Garden are indecisive in regards to a ruling.

**Floppy:**

1. Contribute more than converse. It is a casual channel but the main purpose is for aid or opinion in regards to programming and related interests.

**#Mire:**

1. Only a simple reminder to adhere to site-wide rules stand.
   Mire could be subjected to content pruning at any given moment.

**#Meta:**

1. Keep it topical. Only discussions regarding dotChat as an environment, suggestions for improvements, requests pertaining to dotChat et.c.
2. Argue elsewhere. **#Mire** might be suited for this if necessary.

**#Weeb:**

1. Never go full Hentai.

**#Duvember:**

1. If you're not currently employed and/or contractually involved with either Duva nor Ember, leave or get kicked.
2. Do not ever invite any other people into this channel, it would breach employment contracts with possible legal ramifications.

#### Further elaborations:

**Lawn: Rule no1**. This is the place where everyone is allowed to partake in social interaction. In order to house such a channel where as many users as possible get as good of an experience out of it as possible it is important to not only known and lead by the site-wide rules, but to act as if they are magnified in this room.

Do speak your mind, but tread lightly, avoid divisive topics or off-putting topics to the best of your abilities. Do all that you can so as to not cripple the fairly volatile patch of grass on which we greet new people and try our best to fraternize.

If you don't like it you _might_ like **#Mire**.

**Floppy: Rule no1.** If any member is asking for a helping hand you might not be able to help, but you're most likely capable of being a good enough friend to point that person in the right direction. Do not run over another members plea for help with the latest news article pertaining to code or a meme that only you will enjoy.

**Weeb.Rule no1**. Just.. use common decency. Anything for shits and giggles is fine, just don't push the tastelessness.
